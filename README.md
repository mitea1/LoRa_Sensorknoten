#LoRa-Sensornode Firmware for Multitech mDot
A multifunctional modular Library based on ARM mBed provides a widerange of functionality for several Sensors. 
It allows you to build quickly build a Sensor for Proof of Concept implementations.

##Supported Sensors
+ MAX44009
+ BME280
+ MPU9250
+ Si1143
+ uBlox M8Q

##Idea
The Firmware has some predefined Application Modes running different Tasks(Measurements). Each mode can be used in a different Scenario.
And you can build your own modes for your own Scenario in which you want to use the Sensornode.
